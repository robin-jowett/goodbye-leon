## What's This

This is the goodbye card for Leon, but like, I'm afraid of the post office and love Verified commits, so submit your PRs!

### Instructions

Make a section, commit straight to `main`, don't overwrite people's messages. You were trusted enough to join the company, I trust you enough not to screw up this file lol.
